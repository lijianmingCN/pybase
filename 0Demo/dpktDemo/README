dpkt is a great packet decoding library that is poorly documented and has few 
examples.  In this project, I propose that we document dpkt.  For each
protocol, there is a set of functions.  Each function needs to be documented.
We will also create sample packet captures and software that decodes the sample
packet captures.

Each protocol is a deliverable.  Each function is a deliverable.  Each sample
packet capture is a deliverable.

The list of packet captures for testing purposes is given in the file 
test_cases.txt, which is a tab-delimited file giving the file name and test
conditions the file was generated under.

To install dpkt under ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install python-dpkt
sudo apt-get install python-libpcap
